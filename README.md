NetCDF bindings for PHP 7
=========================

Development phases:

 * making sure everything compiles and works with PHP 7+ (the code was originally written for PHP 5)
 * adding wrappers for as many as possible native netCDF functions
 * converting native netCDF interface into more PHP-friendly (+object-oriented) interface
